This program mathematically determines what choice a person should make given two or more options.

The program initally asks for:
1. What the decision is
2. What options to choose from
3. What factors go into consideration for the options
4. How the person weighs each factor
5. How each option satisfies the factor

The ratings are given on a scale of 1-10. The user should input digits only.

At the end, the program calculates which option best suits the person's needs based on the user inputs.
The highest scoring option is the "best" choice
